documentation:
We parse the program file using regex and then we iterate over all the tokens in order to find what every token is:
if the token is an identifier and the token before it is a define token then we save it in the symbol table with the value 0
constant (strings and numbers) are saved in the symbol table as values. The pif gets populated for each token with
-1 for a keyword and with ('id', 'var_name') for variables
