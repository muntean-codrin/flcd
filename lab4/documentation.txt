We parse the file in order to obtain the possible states, initial state, out states, the alphabet and the transitions as triplets
After that we have a funciton that can check if starting from 1 state it can reach antoher state based on a given sequence
It checks all the valid tranactions and checkes that your sequence matches that transactions step by step by calling itself recursively



BNF format of the fa.in file is inputFile

non_zero_digit = 1|2| .. |9
digit = 0|1|..|9
number = non_zero_digit{digit}
letter = a|b|..|z|A|B..|Z
character = letter | digit
line1 = "states={" {character} {"," character} "}"
line2 = “initial_state””=”{character}
line3 = "out_states" "=" "{" {character} {"," character} "}"
line4 = "alphabet" "=" "{" {character} {"," character} "}"
triplet = "(" {character} "," {character} "," {character} ")"
line5 = "transitions" "=" "{" triplet {";" triplet} "}"
inputFile = line1 "\n" line2 "\n" line3 "\n" line4 "\n" line5
